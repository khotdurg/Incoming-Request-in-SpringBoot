Note: Here we have not used @RequestBody annotation as it is used to handle POST requests; since we are not sending any
data in the request body so, there is no need for @RequestBody annotation here.

If we want to add @RequestBody annotation to handle GET request, we should use a different HTTP method i.e. @PostMapping
instead of @GetMapping. Below is the code implementation for the same.
POST : http://localhost:8080/get
{
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Durgesh",
    "age": "3"
}
